Welcome to my digital space! Here, I share information about my professional background, areas of interest, projects, publications, and contact details.

I am a professor, researcher, and consultant in the areas of Finance and Quantitative Methods, with an interest in Information Technology. A brief description of my personal background can be found here.

My professional experience has provided me with the opportunity to teach various undergraduate and graduate courses (Econometrics, Psychometrics, Financial Mathematics, Investment Analysis, Corporate Finance, Corporate Governance, Behavioral Finance, Capital Markets, Project Management, Accounting, etc.), where I have had the pleasure of interacting with hundreds of students and sharing my knowledge. I have also been involved in dozens of consulting and research projects throughout my career, a brief description of which can be found here.

I also dedicate a page of this digital space to describe (objectives, data used, and methodology) some data analysis projects (Data Science portfolio) that I have carried out since 2015, using varied statistical tools, different levels of complexity, and in diverse areas of knowledge.

In addition to teaching, I am passionate about research, having published some scientific articles with applications of quantitative methods in the areas of finance and management. More recently, I have been dedicated to producing materials on statistical and computational literacy for applied social scientists, with the publication of tutorial articles and solutions for reproducible research, some of which can be found here.

Last but not least, I also dedicate space to talk a bit about the "Psico&Econo_METRIA" project. This is an extension project whose main focus is maintaining a channel on YouTube (and other social networks) with the objective of scientific production and dissemination, specifically, data analysis in the context of business (Econometrics) and applied social sciences (Psychometrics). More recently, this project has also sponsored courses and workshops on tools for reproducible quantitative research, in the context of Open Science.

It's a pleasure to have you here and feel free to get in touch. I will make a tremendous effort to assist you.
