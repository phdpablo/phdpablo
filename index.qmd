**Welcome to my digital space!** ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥°ðŸ¤© Here, I share information about my professional background, areas of interest, projects, publications, and contact details.

I am a professor, researcher, and consultant in the areas of **Finance** **and Quantitative Methods**, with an interest in **Information Technology**. A brief description of my personal background can be found [here](https://phdpablo.github.io/phdpablo/about.html).

My professional experience has provided me with the opportunity to teach various **undergraduate and graduate courses** (Econometrics, Psychometrics, Financial Mathematics, Investment Analysis, Corporate Finance, Corporate Governance, Behavioral Finance, Capital Markets, Project Management, Accounting, etc.), where I have had the pleasure of interacting with hundreds of students and sharing my knowledge. I have also been involved in **dozens of consulting and research projects** throughout my career, a brief description of which can be found [here](https://phdpablo.github.io/phdpablo/cv.html).

I also dedicate a [page](https://phdpablo.github.io/phdpablo/portfolio.html) of this digital space to describe (objectives, data used, and methodology) some data analysis projects (**Data Science portfolio**) that I have carried out since 2015, using varied statistical tools, different levels of complexity, and in diverse areas of knowledge.

In addition to teaching, I am passionate about research, having published some **scientific articles** with applications of quantitative methods in the areas of **finance and management**. More recently, I have been dedicated to producing materials on **statistical and computational literacy** for applied social scientists, with the publication of **tutorial articles** and solutions for **reproducible research**, some of which can be found [here](https://phdpablo.github.io/phdpablo/papers.html).

Last but not least, I also dedicate [space](https://phdpablo.github.io/phdpablo/psico.html) to talk a bit about the **"Psico&Econo_METRIA" project**. This is an extension project whose main focus is maintaining a [channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/PsicoEconoMETRIA) (and other social networks) with the objective of **scientific production and dissemination**, specifically, data analysis in the context of business (**Econometrics**) and applied social sciences (**Psychometrics**). More recently, this project has also sponsored courses and workshops on tools for **reproducible quantitative research**, in the context of **Open Science**.

It's a pleasure to have you here and feel free to get in touch ðŸ˜‰. I will make a tremendous effort to assist you ðŸ¤ž.
