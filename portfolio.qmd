On this page, I present the data analysis projects I've participated in over the past few years. Unfortunately, I've only organized and documented reports from projects between 2015 and the present. I evaluated hundreds of other databases between 2002 and 2014, but those analyses got lost in the "limbo" (ü§£üòÇüòÅ).


The projects are classified by area and identified with a generic title, which may or may not be a translation of the original work (whether published or not). For each project, I provide a brief description of the goals, characteristics of the data used, and the statistical methodology (technique, analysis, or tests) employed.


These projects don't include the quantitative analyses I did in my academic research, which can be found on the Publications page.

## Exploration of Amazon lan Chestnut (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.) in Southern Roraima: Meaning and Local Ecological Knowledge of Farmers

-   **Objectives:** To examine the meaning of being an extractive amazon nut for farmers in Southern Roraima, integrating their experiences in the activity, cultural aspects, and local ecological knowledge about the species' conservation. The study aimed to relate experience in activity, cultural aspects, and local ecological knowledge with the conservation of the species.
