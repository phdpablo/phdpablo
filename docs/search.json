    "text": "Psico&Econo_METRIA is an extension project of the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia, which I coordinate. Its objective is the production and dissemination of science on YouTube, specifically focusing on methods, techniques, and quantitative modeling used by researchers in applied social sciences in Brazil, particularly in administration, accounting, economics, psychology, education, and related fields.\n\n  \nWith this project, we aim to translate the knowledge acquired from Econometrics and Psychometrics books into videos and accessible language for social scientists across Brazil. This will assist them in the decision-making, development, and execution of quantitative methodologies and data analysis for their master‚Äôs dissertations, doctoral theses, research projects, and high-impact scientific articles.\nMy future goal is to have everything we are doing at Psico&Econo_METRIA organized and structured in this ‚Äúcorner‚Äù of the internet ü§û, and eventually create our own website for the project üôå. In the meantime, if you want to know what we are up to, take a look at our YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "I was ‚Äútrained‚Äù in the culture of data modeling. I don‚Äôt think it could have been any other way, because the concept was to be a financial researcher from a young age, with the goal of extracting knowledge about the nature of the relationship between response variables and explanatory variables.\n\nSo, over the last two decades, I‚Äôve evaluated hundreds (yes, hundreds of articles and consulting reports!) of databases using classical statistical approaches such as Descriptive Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, ANOVA, Regression Analysis, Multivariate Analysis, Generalized Linear Model, Generalized Estimating Equation, Generalized Mixed Model, Time Series Analysis, Structural Equation Modeling, Spatial Analysis, Item Response Theory, and Computational Simulation.\nThe Econometrics discipline was my foundation for the first 15 years; however, in the last seven years, I have focused on the Psychometrics discipline, due to a high demand to work with latent variables and validate measurement instruments, and, of course, because I have fallen in love with psychometrics techniques. Anyway, I‚Äôve always worked with health experts during this time, so I‚Äôm comfortable with their procedures and language. In this context, I attempted to master a variety of proprietary software, including Excel, SPSS, Stata, Eviews, Amos, SmartPLS, and Statistica, as well as open-source software, including R, JASP, jamovi, GPower, and GeoDa.\nHowever, in recent years, especially after 2020, I have focused my efforts on algorithmic modeling culture in order to work with massive databases and focus on prediction. As a result, I have worked to improve my understanding of the following machine learning techniques: Lasso and Ridge Regressions, KNN, Random Forests, Bagging, Boosting, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Other subjects in this culture (Linear Regression, Logistics and Stepwise, Decision Trees, Discriminant Analysis, Cluster Analysis, and Principal Components Analysis) are familiar to me because they are already widely used in the data modeling culture, and I have worked on them in dozens of situations.\nIn this context, I have attempted to study the most popular Data Science tools, including SQL, R, Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scipy, scikit-learn, and so on), PowerBi, and Tableau. I‚Äôve used RStudio and Jupyter as IDEs within the Anaconda environment. But isn‚Äôt that the least of this information? As I frequently emphasize, tools are ephemeral!\nI frequently tell this story‚Ä¶ I spent five years using proprietary structural equation modeling software that no longer works for me. I performed a lot of research and decided on a free one that would initially fit me. It took me an afternoon to master this new software: I knew what all the small buttons (choices) I had to hit (take). First and foremost, comprehend the techniques!\nBelow I present a brief summary of my skills, educational background and experience.

    "text": "I‚Äôm Pietro and Alice‚Äôs father, as well as Maressa‚Äôs husband. I come from a poor home and had to start working at the age of 14. However, I always believed that education might improve my financial situation, therefore I never gave up. I spent my whole childhood in public school, and at the age of 20, I took a difficult decision: to enroll in two concurrent higher education courses (full-time economics and accounting sciences at night). Because my parents couldn‚Äôt financially support me while I finished my studies, I did all I could to earn some ‚Äúexchanged‚Äù: scientific initiation scholarship, disciplinary monitoring, consultant of the junior firm of the accounting sciences course, and, most importantly, computer technician. The procedure was difficult, but I was able to complete both.\n\nPerhaps because I was interested, restless, and intrigued by challenges, I opted to pursue an academic career in the third period of my two graduations. I passed various master‚Äôs degree selection procedures and selected to do the master‚Äôs degree in Administration at UFU since I still had to finish the accounting sciences course at the same university and was going to marry Maressa. I received a scholarship for my master‚Äôs degree and had a notable performance: to this day, stories are repeated about how one student managed to produce 35 papers in two years! Secret = a passion for statistical analysis and a willingness to assist everyone who approaches him.\nAt the age of 24, I was already an university professor, and while working on my master‚Äôs thesis, I attempted to expand my understanding of quantitative methods with a focus on applied statistics. At the same time, I completed the PhD process in administration at FEA/USP and the public contest for professor at the Federal University of Vi√ßosa (UFV). I went every week for two years, 12 hours to go and 12 hours back, to complete the PhD disciplines in S√£o Paulo while also teaching at UFV. In 2008, I won a public contest for a permanent teaching position in my hometown and university, and in 2011, I completed my PhD in Finance at FEA/USP with honors: around 40 published articles and thesis recognized worldwide, as well as the KPMG/IBEF Revelation Award in Finance and several media reports in Brazil. After all, it was a very contentious topic: I demonstrated that credit rating may be improved using psychological measures!\nYou can continue reading more details about my educational and professional trajectory on this page üëâhere.\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "On this page, I present the data analysis projects I‚Äôve participated in over the past few years. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve only organized and documented reports from projects between 2015 and the present. I evaluated hundreds of other databases between 2002 and 2014, but those analyses got lost in the ‚Äúlimbo‚Äù ü§£üòÇüòÅ.\n\nThe projects are classified by area and identified with a generic title, which may or may not be a translation of the original work (whether published or not). For each project, I provide a brief description of the goals, characteristics of the data used, and the statistical methodology (technique, analysis, or tests) employed.\nThese projects don‚Äôt include the quantitative analyses I did in my academic research, which can be found on the Publications page.\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of the environmental dimension in the quality of the services of a university library by the SERVQUAL methodology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: To examine the influence of the importance of environmental practices on the perceived quality of library services. The study investigated the relationship between the degree of importance assigned to environmental practices by library users and their perception of service quality.\nData: Data collected through a questionnaire incorporating five questions measuring the importance of environmental practices and the SERVQUAL scale for libraries.\nMethodology: Reliability of the SERVQUAL scale was assessed. An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted on environmental practice variables. Spearman correlations were used to examine the relationship between SERVQUAL dimensions, environmental practice factor, and profile variables. Kruskal-Wallis test was also employed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet retail hubs or shopping malls? Comparing low-income preferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: To compare low-income consumer preferences for street retail hubs versus shopping malls. The project aimed to replicate a 2012 study that compared these two retail cluster types.\nData: Data from a pre-existing study, with additional data collected through questionnaires to validate the findings. The study included profile variables and information on consumer preferences.\nMethodology: Initially, a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was planned but replaced with pre-tests and quantitative data treatment including reliability analysis (Cronbach‚Äôs Alpha). Descriptive statistics, comparison of means, and Multiple Regression Analysis were employed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn evaluation of the allocation of CIDE technology to the Program of Incentive to Interaction University Company to Support Technological Innovation: a FINEP case study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: To evaluate the allocation of CIDE technology resources to the Program for Stimulating University-Company Interaction to Support Innovation (FINEP case study). The aim was to determine if the resource allocation aligned with the stipulated percentages.\nData: Historical data on resource allocation from Law 10.168/2000.\nMethodology: Descriptive analysis of aggregated data was conducted to evaluate the historical allocation of resources and compare it with the legal provisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket orientation, learning guidance and business performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: To evaluate the association between market orientation constructs, learning orientation, and perceived business performance.\nData: Data collected from a small sample of respondents through questionnaires.\nMethodology: Due to the small sample size and limitations of the measurement instruments, nonparametric correlations (Spearman and Kendall‚Äôs Partial Correlation) were used instead of the initially intended Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert Report on Sample Calculation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: To provide a technical report clarifying statistical aspects of sample calculations to assist the court in a case involving audited glosses at a private hospital.\nData: Spreadsheet of audited glosses from a private hospital.\nMethodology: The report provided technical explanations and clarifications regarding sample calculations and statistical considerations relevant to the court‚Äôs decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlaughter industry in Brazil: analysis of the costs of accidents and illnesses at work\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: To identify, estimate, and project the financial costs associated with sick leave due to workplace accidents and illnesses in the poultry slaughter industry.\nData: Data from 3,526 cases of withdrawals due to accidents/illnesses in a poultry processing plant, along with company payroll data.\nMethodology: Data cleaning and structuring were performed. Costs were estimated based on wage payments, receipts, compensation, taxes, and contributions. Analysis was conducted based on gender, functions, sectors, and types of diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR&D Internationalization: Degree of technological complexity attributed to multinational subsidiaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: To evaluate the research methodology employed in a study on R&D internationalization and the degree of technological complexity attributed to multinational subsidiaries. Specifically, to describe the application of Structural Equations Modeling (SEM).\nData: Data from the research study ‚ÄúInternationalization of R&D: analysis of the degree of technological complexity attributed to multinational subsidiaries‚Äù.\nMethodology: Description of the quantitative research procedures, with a focus on the application of SEM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationships between environmental variables and organizational variables in startup performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: To investigate the relationship between environmental and organizational variables and startup performance.\nData: Data collected through research on startups, including information on environmental and organizational variables and performance indicators.\nMethodology: The project proposed the use of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). If data limitations prevented SEM application, descriptive analysis, bivariate analyses (correlation analysis and hypothesis tests), and potentially exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were suggested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Public University Planning: The Case of the Institutional Project of UNIPAMPA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: To evaluate the implementation of the Institutional Plan (PI) of the Federal University of Pampa - UNIPAMPA.\nData: Data collected through a structured questionnaire applied to UNIPAMPA managers. The questionnaire covered strategic planning, resource allocation, processes, leadership, and attitudes.\nMethodology: Principal Components Analysis was used to reduce the dimensions of the questionnaire. Relationships between identified factors and other variables were explored using Pearson or Spearman correlation and mean tests. Descriptive statistics were also employed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights into Financial Sustainability in Third Sector Educational Organizations aimed at People with Disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: To investigate perceptions of high and middle management regarding financial sustainability in APAES (Association of Parents and Friends of Exceptional Children) in Goi√°s and Esp√≠rito Santo.\nData: Data collected through qualitative and quantitative methods, including a semi-structured questionnaire with open and closed questions.\nMethodology: Descriptive statistics and Content Analysis were employed for data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality of Relationship and Co-creation of Value in Interorganizational Relations of Innovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: Investigate the association between Relationship Quality (QRL) and Value Co-creation (CCV) among organizational actors collaborating in innovation projects.\nData: Responses from a validated questionnaire on key constructs (QRL and CCV), collected from organizations participating in innovation projects across the national territory. Strategic decision-makers within companies were the target participants.\nMethodology: Variance-based Structural Equation Modeling (VB-SEM) using the PLS-SEM algorithm was employed due to the complexity of the measurement models (third-order hierarchical) and the formative nature of the constructs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Influence of Governance Modes on Transition Initiatives for Sustainable Cities Based on ODS-11.2 and 11.6: A Study in Municipalities in the Southern Region of Brazil\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: Verify the effects of different municipal public governance modes on transition initiatives to sustainable cities, considering targets 11.2 and 11.6 of ODS-11, in municipalities located in Southern Brazil.\nData: Survey data from 185 questionnaires collected from cities with over 20,000 inhabitants. The questionnaire included information on municipality characteristics, respondent demographics, municipal governance, and initiatives aimed at transitioning to sustainable cities.\nMethodology: Variance-based SEM (VB-SEM) using the Partial Least Squares SEM (PLS-SEM) algorithm due to the formative nature of the constructs and the complexity of the model (structural model with reflective and third-order composite constructs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Perceived Discrimination and Strategies for Coping with LGBTI+ People in Consumer Relations in Brazil\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: Measure perceived discrimination and coping strategies adopted by LGBTI+ consumers in Brazilian consumer relations.\nData: Questionnaire data from 325 individuals on discrimination in consumer relations, coping strategies, and sociodemographic information.\nMethodology: Validation of measurement models and adjustment of a structural model within the framework of Variance-based Structural Equation Modeling (VB-SEM) using the PLS-SEM algorithm, performed in SmartPLS 4.0 software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial literacy, personality traits and emotional intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: Collect information on financial literacy (knowledge, attitude, behavior), the Big Five personality traits, and emotional intelligence. The goal is to explore the relationships between these variables.\nData: Data on financial literacy, Big Five personality traits, and emotional intelligence were collected through established psychometric scales.\nMethodology: Reliability analysis was conducted for each measurement model due to their good psychometric properties. Multiple Regression Analysis (MLR) was then performed as requested by the sponsor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstitutional vacuum, deficit in basic sanitation and health problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: Investigate the relationship between institutional vacuum and health problems, mediated by a lack of basic sanitation, in Brazilian municipalities from 2010 to 2019.\nData: Sociodemographic variables, health data, and sanitation data aggregated at the municipal level from 2010-2019.\nMethodology: Two main approaches were used: 1) PCA followed by longitudinal mediation models (Cross-Lagged Panel Model, Latent Growth Mediation Model, Latent Change Model, Random Slopes Model, Latent Interactions Model, Path Analysis); and 2) Complete process analysis using PLS-SEM (Evolution model and Change model). Ultimately, Path Analysis with random intercepts and measurement models from 27 PCAs was the chosen method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Influence of Dynamic Capabilities on Digital Disruption Efforts of Companies Inserted in Knowledge-Intensive Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ecosystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: Investigate the influence of dynamic capabilities on digital disruption efforts, considering the mediating effect of knowledge intensity in companies within innovation and knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship ecosystems.\nData: Quantitative data from a questionnaire applied to 273 individuals working in companies within innovation environments. The questionnaire included previously validated scales for dynamic capabilities, business performance, and digital platform capacity, and the measurement model for knowledge intensity was adapted from Autio et al.¬†(2000).\nMethodology: A complex structural model was adjusted using PLS-SEM. This involved a third-order measurement model for dynamic capabilities, a second-order model for digital platform capacity, a reflexive model for knowledge intensity, and a formative model for process performance.
